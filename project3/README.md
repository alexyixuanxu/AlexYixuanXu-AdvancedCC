# Project 3
This folder contains only the necessary code for viewing purposes as the original files are too large.

This is a two-part project.

For the 1st one, press key 1 or 2 or 3 then press space to display. Press enter to save images.

Then run the 2nd program, which will randomly draw out the images you saved at first.
